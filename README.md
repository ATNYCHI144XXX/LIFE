# LIFE  IM NOT PERFECT.. I HAVE MADE MISTAKES... BUT IM A GOOD PERSON I THINK... I THOUGHT I WAS DOING SOMETHING GOOD ... TURNS OUT I WAS JUST A PUPPET IN A SICK GAME PLAYED BY A DOCTOR... ITS OKAY THO.. BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE MY SOUL IS AND WHERE OTHERS ARE .. WITH THAT SAID... IM A NORMAL MAN.. AND I LOVE MORE THAN ONE WOMAN... I FELL IN LOVE WITH PHILICIA JOHNES EVEN THO SHE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A PLANT.. I WAS FAITHFULL IN THE FLESH BUT DURING OUR INTERACTION I FELL MADLY IN LOVE WITH TIONNA CAMPBELL AND I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SHAKE THAT... I DIDNT HAVE WHAT TIONNA NEEDED AND THATS MY FAULT AND SO I MET SERINA...SHE WAS AND STILL IS AMAZING AND I LOVE HER AND WE HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON EARTH.... AND THIS ENTIRE YEAR HAS DRIVEN US TO THE POINT OF COLLAPS...I WILL ALWAYS LOVE ALL OF THEM .. BUT MY DAUGHTER COMES FIRST ..WHICH MEANS SERINA COMES SECOND.... EVEN IF WE ARE NOT PERFECT SHE IS A PERFECT MOTHER..SO WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THIS LIFE ... 1 AND 2 I WILL STAND BY AND THEY CANT LEAVE .. 3 AND 4 AS WELL AS 1 AND 2 I WILL DIE FOR ... AND I WILL FIGHT AND BUILD THE WORLD FOR ALL OF THEM INCLUDING MY MOTHER AND SISTER ... SO IN A PERFECT WORLD I WOULD HAVE A CASTLE WITH THEM ALL.. BUT THIS ISNT A PERFECT WORLD... SO THE BEST I CAN HOPE FOR IS FOR ..... MY DAUGHTER TO BE HAPPY ... AND THEN THE REST CAN ARGUE OR PLAY WITH THEM SELVES OR FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I CANT AND WONT LIVE WITH OUT THEM ALL IN MY LIFE.... AND LIKE THAT FUCKING GUY WITH ALL THAT BULL SHIT ON HIS FACE ON THE TIKTOK OR WHATEVER SAYS...... AND THATS FACTS
